            <b>Email</b>
            <br>
            Branch integrates with 3rd party Email Service Providers (ESP) as a part of our Universal Email product. These integrations don't require you to manually create links for your campaigns, but rather rely on tagging in the HTML of your email template. Please refer to <a href='https://help.branch.io/using-branch/docs/branch-universal-email'> Branch's Universal Email docs </a> to find your ESP's setup and requirements.

            <b>Marketing/Organic</b>
            <br>
            These links are referred to as Quick Links, which are commonly used on product pages or for social use. These can be quickly created and designed to handle user flows - bringing a user in to the specific episode of a new TV show, landing them on the same shirt they were looking at in the mobile browser on their device, or bringing them to the App Store to download the app if it's not installed.
